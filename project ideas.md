   **Tech**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Google Sheets API.

### 3. **Flask/Django Web App**
   - **Skills**: Web development, database management.
   - **Description**: Build a simple web application using Flask or Django. You could create a blog, a task manager, or a portfolio site.
   - **Bonus**: Add user authentication (using OAuth or JWT), deploy it to Heroku or AWS, and implement a front-end framework like React or Vue.js.
   
   **Tech**: Flask, Django, SQLite/PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### 4. **Automation Tool (e.g., Email/Social Media Bot)**
   - **Skills**: Automation, scheduling, APIs.
   - **Description**: Write a bot that automates repetitive tasks like sending emails, posting to social media, or scraping data regularly. You can use Python’s `smtplib` for emails or APIs like Twitter’s API.
   - **Bonus**: Set up the bot to run automatically using `cron` jobs or on a cloud platform (like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions).
   
   **Tech**: Tweepy, smtplib, Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda.

### 5. **REST API Service**
   - **Skills**: API design, backend development.
   - **Description**: Create a RESTful API service using Flask or FastAPI. You could build an API that serves a specific dataset, such as weather data or a to-do list.
   - **Bonus**: Add authentication, deploy it on a cloud service, and write comprehensive documentation for your API.
   
   **Tech**: Flask, FastAPI, Postman, Docker.

### 6. **Machine Learning Model**
   - **Skills**: Data science, machine learning.
   - **Description**: Use Python libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` to create a machine learning model. You could build something simple like a classification model (e.g., predicting whether an email is spam).
   - **Bonus**: Deploy the model as an API or web service that others can interact with, or integrate it into a larger project.
   
   **Tech**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy.

### 7. **Portfolio Website**
   - **Skills**: Web development, Git.
   - **Description**: Build a personal portfolio showcasing your projects, resume, and skills. This project doubles as a real-world application to show potential employers.
   - **Bonus**: Host it on GitHub Pages or any cloud platform, and keep it updated with new projects.
   
   **Tech**: HTML/CSS, Flask/Django, Git, GitHub Pages.

### 8. **Command-Line To-Do List Manager**
   - **Skills**: Command-line interfaces, file handling, OOP.
   - **Description**: Create a Python script that acts as a to-do list manager in the terminal. It should allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as done.
   - **Bonus**: Add persistence using a JSON or SQLite database and schedule tasks using Python's `sched` or `schedule` libraries.
   
   **Tech**: argparse, SQLite, JSON.

### 9. **Weather Dashboard**
   - **Skills**: API interaction, data visualization.
   - **Description**: Build an app that fetches weather data from an API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays it in a nice format. You can include features like a 7-day forecast or weather alerts.
   - **Bonus**: Use a web framework to display the weather data on a website or create a desktop app with `Tkinter` or `PyQt`.
   
   **Tech**: Requests, Flask, OpenWeatherMap API, Matplotlib.

### 10. **Chat Application**
   - **Skills**: Networking, real-time communication.
   - **Description**: Build a simple chat app using sockets that allows multiple users to communicate in real time.
   - **Bonus**: Add user authentication, channels, or a web interface for the chat.
   
   **Tech**: Sockets, Flask-SocketIO, WebSockets.

### 11. **Blockchain-Based Voting System**
   - **Skills**: Cryptography, distributed systems.
   - **Description**: Build a simple blockchain voting system where users can vote on proposals, and the votes are recorded in a secure, immutable ledger.
   - **Bonus**: Visualize the blockchain or implement advanced consensus algorithms.
   
   **Tech**: Cryptography, Flask, SQLite, PyCryptodome.

### 12. **Data Analysis/Visualization Tool**
   - **Skills**: Data processing, visualization.
   - **Description**: Build a tool that processes datasets (e.g., CSVs or databases) and provides insights through visualizations. You could use this for real-world datasets like stock prices or COVID-19 data.
   - **Bonus**: Allow users to upload their own datasets and get custom visualizations.
   
   **Tech**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dash.
